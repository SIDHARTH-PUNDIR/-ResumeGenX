*ResumeGenX is a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) compiler equipped with a sleek local Web UI. It parses a custom Resume Definition Language (`.rdl`), performs strict semantic validation, and generates professional, ATS-friendly LaTeX source code and PDF binaries.*

*Developed as an academic project for the B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering program at Graphic Era (Deemed to be) University.*

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Custom Compiler Pipeline:** Built entirely from scratch in Java, featuring a custom `Lexer`, `Parser`, and `SemanticAnalyzer` to process `.rdl` syntax.
*   **Intelligent Semantic Analysis:** Catches logical gaps (e.g., missing mandatory fields, unusually formatted dates, or brief descriptions) and feeds them directly to the UI's live terminal console.
*   **Dynamic Data Engine:** Utilizes a generic dynamic key parsing algorithm, allowing users to invent any custom data fields without breaking the layout.
*   **Modern Web IDE:** A beautiful, dark-themed frontend running on `localhost:8080` that includes:
    *   A template selection gallery.
    *   An animated, real-time developer terminal for compiler warnings/errors.
    *   Instant Base64 PDF streaming and LaTeX export.
*   **Five Professional Layouts:** Hard-coded generators applying strict "Golden Rules" (unbreakable `minipage` blocks, 12pt/14pt typography). Layouts include: *Clean Minimal, Modern Split, Academic Pro, Centered Elegant, and Creative Bold*.
*   **100% Deterministic Output:** Translates validated Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) into flawless LaTeX, bypassing the hallucinations of LLM-based generators.
*   **Privacy-First & Energy Efficient:** Runs entirely locally on minimal CPU power, providing a sustainable and secure alternative to cloud-based AI tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or higher.
2.  **LaTeX Engine:** Required to compile the generated `.tex` files into binary PDFs.
    *   [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows) — *Crucial: Set "Install missing packages on-the-fly" to **Yes** during installation.*
    *   [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (macOS)
    *   TeX Live (Linux via `sudo apt install texlive-full`)
3.  **Environment Variables:** Ensure the `bin` folder of your LaTeX distribution (e.g., `...\miktex\bin\x64`) is added to your system's `PATH`.
